<!--This is some introduction text to our research-->

Some scientific ideas we are excited to pursue in the upcoming years include:

- NMR
- EPR
- DNP

Watch this space for expansion, photos, and results as the lab gets constructed! I am always interested in chatting with prospective students and postdocs about new and interesting directions to take the experiment in the lab.
